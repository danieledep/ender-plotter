# ender-plotter

Transform a 3d printer in a pen plotter, in this repo there are multiple files to do that.

- A pen holder made up of three separate parts that can be mounted and unmounted on the stock Ender 3 extruder head
- SVG template files for using Inkscape gcode extensions as a starting point to print your svg file
- header and footer gcode instructions files to be appended at the beginning and end of your generated gcode
